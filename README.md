# SCP_Simulation_of_MIL101Cr

Evaluated the Dynamic Performance of Metal-organic Frameworks in Adsorption Heat Pumps via Multi-scale Modeling
The refrigeration performance of MIL-101Cr/ethanol working pair in AHPs was simulated to obtain the coefficient of performance (COP) and specific cooling power (SCP) values
The initial parameter reference for the multi-scale model is from [1].
The experimental parameters reference is from [2].
